# SIMPLE IMAGE ENCRYPTION TOOL

## Image Encryption Using Pixel Manipulation

This is my second task assigned as part of my internship at SkillCraft Technology. This task involves creating a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation techniques. The project includes the following components:

- Create a program that can encrypt and decrypt images by manipulating pixel values.
- Support operations like swapping pixel values or applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel.
- Ensure the program outputs the encrypted or decrypted image clearly and accurately based on user input.

## Installation & Usage

Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required libraries.
4. Run the program.
5. Follow the instructions to input your image file and choose an encryption or decryption operation.

## Example

- Type `encrypt` for Encryption and `decrypt` for Decryption.
- For Encryption:
  - Type `encrypt`.
  - Enter the path to the image file (Example of a valid file path: `/home/user/Pictures/car.JPG`): `/home/user/Pictures/car.JPG`
  - Enter the key value (0-255): `2`
  - Enter the path to save the encrypted image: `/home/user/Pictures/enc.JPG`
  - The image has been successfully encrypted and is stored at the path you provided.
- For Decryption:
  - Type `decrypt`.
  - Enter the path to the image file (Example of a valid file path: `/home/user/Pictures/enc.JPG`): `/home/user/Pictures/enc.JPG`
  - Enter the key value (0-255): `2`
  - Enter the path to save the decrypted image: `/home/user/Pictures/dec.JPG`
  - The image has been successfully decrypted and is stored at the path you provided.
- Type `yes` to continue and `no` to stop.
